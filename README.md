This project is for enhanching the medical images which are suffering from intensity inhomogeneity.

* First we segment the image using Fuzzy C Mean clustering algorithm, which is first and the important step for the bias field estimation.
* Separately remove the bias field of each segmented image.
* Finally added all inhomogeneity free images to get correct and enhanched image.
